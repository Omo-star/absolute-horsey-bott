# 🛠️ 16. Hacker RPG System — `/hack`

A fully simulated **multi-phase hacking RPG** powered by your **own codepad scripts**.  
Every hack evaluates your scripts for performance, efficiency, stealth, stability, and complexity — creating a deeply customizable cyber-RPG loop.

---

### CORE FEATURES
- Four-phase hacking chain: **Recon → Access → Payload → Extraction**  
- Script analysis engine (performance, entropy, recursion, imports, stealth, parallelism, stability)  
- Automatic module selection or manual script assignment  
- Difficulty tiers (1–5) with unique target security profiles  
- Skill, Tier, Reputation, Trace, and XP progression  
- Success quality grading (flawless, barely, almost, failed)  
- Synergy bonuses for archetype alignment or diversity  
- Animated phase-by-phase hack visualization  
- Cooldowns that adapt to skill, tier, and trace  
- Persistent hack history (20 most recent runs stored)

---

### BUTTONLESS SYSTEM  
All actions occur through the `/hack` command and your **codepad**.

### HOW IT WORKS
1. Create code files using `/code_new` and `/code_edit`.  
2. Name them according to role keywords:  
   - **Recon** — recon, scan, probe  
   - **Access** — access, login, auth  
   - **Payload** — payload, inject, exploit  
   - **Extraction** — extract, exfil, leak  
3. Run `/hack` and optionally specify which scripts to use.  
4. Watch the engine analyze your code and simulate a cyber intrusion.

---

### PHASES
- **Reconnaissance** — Mapping endpoints, fingerprinting, topology analysis  
- **Access Vector** — Credential distortion, solver heuristics, exploit probes  
- **Payload Orchestration** — Packing, obfuscation, execution hooks  
- **Extraction** — Proxy braiding, masking envelopes, sealing channels  

Each phase compares:  
**your script power** vs **target threshold**, modified by skill, tier, trace, and synergy.

---

### OUTCOME TYPES
- **Perfect Chain** — Stunning execution; massive XP & stat boosts  
- **Strong** — Solid multi-phase breach  
- **Clean** — Consistent success  
- **Shaky** — Success with instability  
- **Near Miss** — Almost broke in  
- **Messy** — Failed with noise  
- **Catastrophic** — Severe failure; high trace

---

### PROGRESSION
Hacks reward or penalize:
- **XP** (skill-up & tier progression)  
- **Skill** (hack power scaling)  
- **Reputation** (public notoriety)  
- **Trace** (forensic heat)  
- **Streaks** (bonus consistency multiplier)

Trace also increases cooldown time.

---

### CHAIN BUILDING
During execution:
- System animates each phase  
- Evaluates module matchups  
- Calculates margin %, quality, synergy, RNG volatility  
- Produces a detailed final report

---

# 🛡️ 17. AutoMod System — `/automod`

A **lightweight, behavior-based moderation system** designed to keep chat readable **without punishing slang, typos, or casual talk**.

AutoMod focuses on **how users behave**, not *how they type*.

Disabled by default so no suprises :)

**AutoMod is intentionally not very feature-heavy since human moderation is of-course better. AutoMod is recommended because it controls safe parameters to stop immediate threats to your server.**

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- ✅ No punishment for short messages like `fr`, `gg`, `a`
- ✅ Spam is detected by **message bursts**, not message content
- ✅ Slur filtering is **server-configurable**
- ✅ Gradual escalation with clear feedback
- ✅ Fully slash-command controlled
- ✅ Disabled by default

---

## 🚨 PUNISHMENT ESCALATION

AutoMod uses a **4-step escalation ladder**:

1. **First Offense**  
   ⚠️ Public warning pinging the user  
   _Message is deleted_

2. **Second Offense**  
   🔇 5-minute mute (timeout)  
   _Public notice sent_

3. **Third Offense**  
   🚪 User is kicked from the server  
   _Public message: “User was kicked due to reason”_

4. **Fourth Offense**  
   🔨 User is banned  
   _Public message: “User was banned due to reason”_

Offenses are tracked per-user, per-server.

---

## 📊 SPAM DETECTION

Spam is detected using **rate limits**, not content analysis.

**Default rules:**
- 5 or more messages
- Within a 6-second window

This avoids false positives caused by:
- Discord message delays
- Typos
- Casual slang
- Fast conversations

---

## 🚫 SLUR FILTERING

AutoMod supports a **customizable banned word list**.

- Matches whole words only
- Case-insensitive
- Slurs are censored when listed
- Punishment applies immediately

Example display:

- f***
- n****

---

## 🧩 SLASH COMMANDS

### `/automod on`
Enables AutoMod for the server.

### `/automod off`
Disables AutoMod.

---

### `/automod_slurs list`
Shows all configured slurs (censored).

### `/automod_slurs add <word>`
Adds a word to the banned list.

### `/automod_slurs remove <word>`
Removes a word from the banned list.

---

## 🔒 PERMISSIONS

Only users with **moderation privileges** can control AutoMod:
- Manage Messages
- Administrator
- Server Owner

---

## ⚙️ CONFIG STORAGE

AutoMod stores configuration in:

**automod_config.json**


Tracked data includes:
- Enabled / disabled state
- Slur list per server

This file is safe to commit and persists across restarts.

---

## 🧠 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

AutoMod is intentionally **minimal**:
- No AI moderation
- No sentiment guessing
- No typo punishment
- No guessing intent

It exists to stop **spam and abuse**, not normal chat.

---

**Result:**  
Clean channels, fewer false positives, happier users.

---

### SUMMARY
The `/hack` system is a **deep technical RPG** where:
- Your scripts = your equipment  
- Your skill & tier = your stats  
- Trace = your danger meter  
- Each target = a unique puzzle

Build better scripts, form strong phase chains, and climb the hacker ranks.
